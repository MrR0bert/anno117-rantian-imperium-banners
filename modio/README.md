# Rantian Imperium Ornaments

Following the mod for Anno 1800, the Rantian Imperium has expanded into Anno 117 and requires banners to make it's presence known the false emperor and the world!

## Contents

Unlike the 1800 mod, this one is a bit more organized with a dedicated Rantian Imperium Ornaments category in the menu and sub-categories to organize the banners.

These categories are:

1. Rantian Imperium Standard Banners
2. Clan Na Ceo Gaire Banners

Plans on expanding these are in the works!

The mod currently has **8 banners** on a generic, groundless, pole so can place it anywhere you like. Even at the beloved 45-degree angle!

## Credits

Credit where credit's due. As with Anno 1800, I'm still not much of a designer. I made some of the banners but most of the artwork is done by others. So a special shout out to those who made the artwork for this mod!
